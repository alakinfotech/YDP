						<h2>About Us</h2>
						<p>Software projects are inherently complex, risky and require careful planning. Processes include development, estimates, staged development, requirements capture, risk and change management control procedures, business case studies, user interface prototypes and project control. Proper planning ensures that the project doesn't move away from timeline. Our customers receive clear road map of the project, regular updates on the project status and access to project deliverables at any point of time. To ensure the timely and quality delivery for 100% client satisfaction, we implement the following:</p>
                     	<h3>Envisioning:</h3>
                        <p>After we receive a request and initial information for your project, we form a core team that prepares vision/scope documents for your project free of charge. We envision the overall direction for the project, determining which features the solution will and will not include, and a general schedule for delivery.</p>
                       	<h3>Planning:</h3>
                        <p>During planning, the team prepares the functional specifications, works on the design process through, and prepares work plans, cost estimates and schedules for the various deliverables. The stage is completed by formal signing of the contract. In complicated cases, a screen prototype of a new system will also be developed. The mockups thus developed will allow the customer to review the future system and to give their feedback at an early stage of the development.</p>
			<h3>Design And Development:</h3>
                        <p>Our team accomplishes the actual development of solution components (code as well as documentation) in this phase. We keep our customers updated and provide tools to monitor the development so that they know the progress.</p>
      			<h3>Testing:</h3>
                        <p>Completely developed solutions will be tested in this phase. Testing emphasizes usage and operation under realistic environmental conditions. The team focuses on resolving and prioritizing bugs and preparing regular releases.</p>
			<h3>Delivery and Support:</h3>
                        <p>In this phase, AIT team deploys the core technology and site components. Deployment stabilization, transition to operations and support, and obtaining final customer approval will follow. We believe in delivering solutions, not just products. The development team keeps supporting the system after installation, and we provide warranty.</p>
			<h3>Effective Performance:</h3>
			 <p>AIT designs, develops and manages the business processes of development to help clients operate in a better, quicker, smarter and profitable mode, at a lower cost.</p><br>
