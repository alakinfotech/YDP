						<h2>About Us</h2>
						<p>Software projects are inherently complex, risky and require careful planning. Planning software includes development, estimates, staged development, requirements capture, and risk and change management control procedures, business case studies, user interface prototypes and overall project control. Proper planning ensures that the project doesn't move away from its targeted goals while the customer gets a clear definition of the project and is in the know of the project status and has ready access to project deliverables at any point of time. To ensure the timely and quality delivery for 100% client satisfaction we implement the following:</p>
                     	<h4>Envisioning</h4>
                        <p>After we receive a request and initial information for your project, we form a core team that prepares vision/scope documents for your project free of charge. We envision the overall direction for the project, including determining which features the solution will and will not include, and a general schedule for delivery.</p>
                        <h4>Testing</h4>
                        <p>In this phase testing is conducted on a solution whose features are complete. Testing emphasizes usage and operation under realistic environmental conditions. The team focuses on resolving and prioritizing bugs and preparing the solution for release.</p>
                        <h4>Planning</h4>
                        <p>During this phase the team prepares the functional specifications, works the design process through, and prepares work plans, cost estimates and schedules for the various deliverables. The stage is completed by the signing of a contract. In complicated cases a screen prototype of a new system can also be developed. This allows the customer to review the future system and to give their feedback at an early stage of the development.</p>
                        <h4>Delivery and Support</h4>
                        <p>AIT team deploys the core technology and site components, stabilizes the deployment, transitions the project to operations and support, and obtains final customer approval for the project. It is not just a Product that is delivered to the customer, it is a Solution. 
The development team keeps supporting the system after installation, and we also provide a warranty.</p>
                        <h4>Design And Development</h4>
                        <p>Our team accomplishes the building of solution components (code as well as documentation). Our development process is interactive. That means that customers monitor the progress of development online so they won't be faced with any sudden issues at the end.</p>
                        <h4>Effective Performance</h4>
                        <p>AIT designs, develops and manages the business processes of development to help clients operate in a better, quicker, smarter and profitable mode, and at a lower cost.</p>
